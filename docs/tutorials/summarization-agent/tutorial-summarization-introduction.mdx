In this tutorial, we'll go through the entire process of building a robust **LLM-powered summarization agent using DeepEval**, from development to production.

:::tip
If you're working with LLMs for summarization, this tutorial is for you. While we'll specifically focus on evaluating a meeting summarizer, the concepts and practices here can be applied to **any LLM application that generates summaries**.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

- How to build a summarization agent.
- How to define summarization criteria and choose the right evaluation metrics.
- How to evaluate your summarization agent using **DeepEval**.
- How to improve your summarization agent using evaluation results.
- How to prepare your summarization agent for production.

## Meeting Summarizer

The agent we'll be building processes meeting-style transcripts and generates:

- A brief summary of the discussion.
- A list of action items.

Our summarization agent takes the entire conversation transcription as `input` and outputs a concise summary along with clear action items. The goal is to ensure it captures key decisions and follow-ups accuratelyâ€”without missing context, misinterpreting information, or including unnecessary detail.

:::info
We'll be using OpenAI's LLM models to power our summarizer. Here's the prompt template used to guide the model's summaries:
```text
You are an AI assistant tasked with summarizing meeting transcripts clearly 
and accurately. Given the following conversation, generate a concise summary 
that captures the key points discussed, along with a set of action items 
reflecting the concrete next steps mentioned. Keep the tone neutral and 
factual, avoid unnecessary detail, and do not add interpretation beyond 
the content of the conversation.
```
